// Stage 3 — THE BUILD LEG. Public surface.
//
// The third stage of the OMNIS loop: a 6D story (Stage 2) becomes a build
// work-order; an independent builder implements it; the validator runs the
// acceptance criteria as executable probes and refuses anything that fails a
// blocking one. Decide (Agility) → specify (6D) → BUILD + GATE (here) → and the
// verdict + real outcome feed back into the loop. 🐦‍⬛ + 🔑
