// THE BUILD LOOP — REFUSE → RESOLVE → RECOMPUTE, run to a verdict.
//
// The validator (validator.ts) renders a single verdict. This orchestrator turns
// it into a *loop*: build → gate → if REFUSED, hand the exact failing criteria
// back to the builder → it RESOLVEs → RECOMPUTE (re-gate) → repeat until the gate
// says NO_OBJECTION or the round budget is spent. Every round is sealed into the
// LUNA chain, so the build's whole history is tamper-evident — the same ledger
// the 6D spec uses. The receipt rides the whole circle.
//
// The `builder` is injected, which is the load-bearing seam:
//   • in tests — a deterministic fake (round 1 ships broken, round 2 ships fixed)
//     proves the loop mechanics with zero non-determinism.
//   • in the live demo — a real agent reads the brief (incl. the resolve needs)
//     and self-corrects. Same loop, real code.
// 🐦‍⬛ + 🔑
