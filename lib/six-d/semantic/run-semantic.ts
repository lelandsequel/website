// OMNIS Semantic Spec Engine — the run orchestrator.
//
// This is the FIRST-CLASS semantic pipeline: a parallel sibling to v1's runSixD
// where the IntentSemanticModel (NEBULA entity reconciliation + ASTRAL EARS
// typing + the honest frontier report) DRIVES the phases — not rides alongside
// them. v1 (runSixD / phases.ts) stays byte-frozen; this pipeline produces its
// own richer manifest with its own receipt.
//
//   intent → normalize → index → buildSemanticModel (the MEANING)
//          → six phase transforms, each handed the model
//          → manifest (artifacts grounded in reconciled entities + typed reqs)
//
// The semantic model is carried INSIDE the manifest (manifest.semantic), so the
// receipt commits to it transitively (the artifacts are derived from it) and any
// consumer — VELLUM, the loop, a page — can inspect the meaning the spec was
// built from, including the frontier report that names exactly where an LLM
// would still be required. Nothing here is faked: what the deterministic layer
// can't type is surfaced as an open question, never invented.
//
// Phase roster note: Define + Design run their SEMANTIC transforms today;
// Distribute…Deliver currently consume the semantic upstream via ctx.upstream
// (their inputs — stories, ACs, ADRs — are already the reconciled ones) and get
// promoted to model-driven transforms one at a time, always green. The roster
// below is the single place that swap happens.
//
// Pure: no clock, no randomness, no network. Same intent ⇒ same model ⇒ same
// artifacts ⇒ same receipt. 🐦‍⬛ + 🔑
