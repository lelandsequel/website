// 6D Workbench — COSMIC pipeline orchestrator.
//
// This is the upgrade the design memo calls Tier 1: take the v1 run and put it
// through the real COSMIC pipeline shape —
//
//   produce (runSixD) → VELLUM (bind source) → AURORA (gate) →[refused]→ RESOLVE
//                       → RECOMPUTE → LUNA (chain into the append-only ledger)
//
// v1 is UNTOUCHED: we import runSixD from ../engine and consume its manifest. The
// only thing we replace is the *seal* — v1's single-run sha receipt becomes a real
// hash-chained ledger entry (LUNA), and we add the VELLUM provenance pass and the
// AURORA verdict gate around it.
//
// DETERMINISM CONTRACT (same as v1, extended to the chain):
//   Same intent ⇒ same artifacts ⇒ same provenance ⇒ same gate report ⇒ same
//   run-payload hash. And given the same prior ledger state, the same run-payload
//   ⇒ the same chained entry hash. No clock, no network, no Math.random in this path.
//
// 🐦‍⬛ + 🔑
